1)will finally block executes after exit, break, return.
A)finally executes in all senarios except exit which causes JVM failure/terminating the process. Also at power shutdown finally/OS failover wont executes.

2)Difference between string literal and string object(new) ?
A)A string literal is created in string-pool and new string Object is created in heap storage.
In string literal creation if the string is not present in string-pool then only the string is created at string-pool and will be 
reused for further.
In string Object(with new) string object is created in heap and when we create other with same value another will be created. Reuseage
wont be there with string Object.

3)Java memories :- Reff Documents&Pdf section for these concept in detailed.

	JVM memory areas / components
	- Heap area -- contains objects created in program
	- Method area and runtime constant pool   -- contains class data
	- JVM stack -- The Java stack is composed of stack frames (or frames). A stack frame contains the state of one Java method invocation. When a thread invokes a method, the Java virtual machine pushes a new frame onto that thread's Java stack. When the method completes, the virtual machine pops and discards the frame for that method
	- Native method stacks -- Native method stacks is called C stacks; it support native methods (methods written in a language other than the Java programming language), typically allocated per each thread when each thread is created
	- PC registers   -- Each of the JVM threads has its own program counter (pc) register. At any point, each of the JVM threads is executing the code of a single method, namely the current method for that thread.

In JVM there are two main types of memories are avaliable,
	1)Heap Memory
	2)Non-Heap Memory (Method area is part of non-heap memory)
	
Key Takeaways

Local Variables are stored in Frames or java stacks during runtime.
Static Variables are stored in Method Area.
Arrays are stored in heap memory.

Memory pools are created by JVM memory managers during runtime. Memory pool may belong to either heap or non-heap memory.
